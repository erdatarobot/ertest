        <li>"This shadow was merely an exercise in checking the box. Notes were incomplete and it's not clear that the CFDS paid attention."</li>
        <li>"This shadow was only marginally better than having not done one at all. Notes were present but uninformative."</li>
        <li>"Adequate effort was put into this shadow, notes prove that the CFDS paid attention."</li>
        <li>"Above average effort went into this, it's clear that both CFDS met prior to the call and afterwards. Good job."</li>
        <li>"I would use this shadow as an example of the best possible effort. Great work."</li>
